Design Note for Isty Editor:

Jquery
 
.position()  will return the coordinate number if the element is absolute/relative position to its parent.

.offset() will return the coordinate relative to the window (upper left corner)

.offset() is extraly what I need for coordinate of the targeted line.

Note: one black space has width of "4px"


Editor Features:
1) Save/Edit option.
    Edit will trigger a AJAX/REST call to server to "lock" the content from others to edit.
    Save will update the content in server and allow others to edit.

2) Enter will create a new line
3) Line is in a "line div"
4) Paragraph is in a "paragraph div"
5)

Future fetures:
1) Support image insertion with "paste" action.
2) Detect user pasta action and retrieve the "link" or "image" binary.
    Link: Process the link to retrieve the binary
3) Image sits inside <img> tag.
4) TBD if allowing just one <img> per line or more <img> per line.


Editor View:

    Init with a target Div to insert the editor view
    Setup event notification for:
        clicking in the editor view
            which will trigger key capturing for further processing
        clicking outside of the editor view for stopping key captures
        Note: These are for observator(subscriber) to listen for.
    
    MouseCursor? Should be part of View
        Location of mouse click
        Calculate where the cursor should appear
        
        export one Mouse Cursor Object.
        expose the following API:
           moveCursorHere()
           blinkCusor(frequency)
           hideCursor()
           showCursor()
           returnCursorLocation()
           
           

GIT Repository

3 STATES:
    1) Modified  -- Users-modified codes that was previously checked out from Git
    2) Staged  --  Staged (modified) files ready for commit
    3) Commited   --  Version of codes on Git
